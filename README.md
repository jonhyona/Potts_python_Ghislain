# PottsModelPython
Implementation of the Potts model in Python

Example can be found as runsim_example.sh.

Should be run by a bash script that first runs create_pkl_file.py with three arguments: a random cue, g_A and the simulation length. This will create network files necessary to run simulations.

Then one can use run.py with the desired cue, g_A and simulation length.
